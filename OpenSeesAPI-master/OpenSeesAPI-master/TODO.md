## Things that still need to be added
- Add the remaining OpenSees classes
- Organize how the tcl files are written... it could go something like this:
    - Initiate Basic Builder
    - Nodes
    - Materials
    - Sections
    - Elements
    - Shells
    - Restraints/Constraints
    - Output (Recorders)
    - Eigen
    - Loading
    - Gravity Analysis
    - Pushover loading
    - Pushover Solution Algorithm
        - Number
        - System
        - Analysis
        - Constraint
        - Type
        - Test
        - Algorithm
        - Integrator
        - Analysis
    - Ground Motions
    - Dynamic Solution Algorithm
    - Other (Anything can be put here... I sometimes like to run a pushover after a dynamic analysis to see if my structure has collapse... others might want to run another ground-motion)
- Solution Algorithms need to be inserted manually or using a helper
- Shorten callout so that it goes like this:
    - OpenSeesAPI.
        - Analysis.
            - Algorithm
            - Analysis
            - Analyze
            - Constraints
            - Eigen
            - Integrator
            - Numberer
            - System
            - Test
        - Node
        - Element
        - Material.
            - UniaxialMaterial
            - ND Material
        - Section
        - BasicBuilder
        - Constraint
        - Pattern
        - TimeSeries
        - TCL
        - Database
        - Output (Recorders)
        - Executable
        - Misc
