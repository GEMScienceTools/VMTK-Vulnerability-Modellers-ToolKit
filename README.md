# Vulnerability Modellers ToolKit (VMTK)
This is the web repository of the Vulnerability Modeller's ToolKit (VMTK). The VMTK is a suite of tools developed by scientists working at the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation. The toolkit is intended to provide earthquake engineers with a comprehensive platform to develop fragility and vulnerability models.

## Overview
The VMTK is  a set of scripts Python programming language with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The VMTK is divided into six modules designed to guide the user through the different stages of analytical vulnerability modelling. from the selection of ground motion records to the validation and verification of the models.
