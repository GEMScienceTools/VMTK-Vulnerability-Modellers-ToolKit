# Vulnerability Modellers ToolKit (VMTK)
This is the web repository of the Vulnerability Modeller's ToolKit (VMTK). The VMTK is a suite of tools developed by scientists working at the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation. The toolkit is intended to provide earthquake engineers with a comprehensive platform to develop fragility and vulnerability models while allowing a wide flexibility in terms of seismic demand, structural capacity, damage criteria and damage-to-loss conversion.

A comprehensive overview of the toolkit is available through the companion publication at https://doi.org/10.1007/s10518-021-01187-w

## Overview
The VMTK is comprised a set of scripts in Python programming language and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The VMTK is divided into six modules designed to guide the user through the different stages of analytical vulnerability modelling from the selection of ground motion records to the validation and verification of the models.

The toolkit was developed to be easily integrated with other commonly used earthquake engineering software that share the same programming language (namely: OpenQuake and OpenSees).


### VMTK Modules
__1. Demand:__ selection of ground motion records

__2. Capacity:__ definition of structural capacity

__3. Structural analysis:__ nonlinear dynamic analyses on single degree of freedom (SDOF) oscillators to estimate the response of the building under seismic loads

__4. Fragility:__ conversion of the results from the dynamic analyses into fragility functions

__5. Vulnerability:__ derivation of vulnerability functions

__6. Comparison:__ compare the results with other available models

__7.Verification:__ validation of the results through the calculation of average annual losses and other common risk metrics
